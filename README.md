# derrelSORT
Linear - yes, linear - comparative sorting routines.

The theoretical limit for comparative sorting algorithmns has time complexity O(nlogn).
The limit is incorrect.  The routines here sort linearly with respect to the number
of elements to be sorted, O(n).  The derrelSORT-example.py script gives an example
for use in python.
